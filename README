NAME
    Plack::Middleware::Debug::Notepad - Abuse the plack debug panel and keep
    your todo list in it.

SYNOPSIS
     # Using the default file path to store the contents of your notepad:
     builder {
         enable 'Debug', panels => [ qw( Environment Response Notepad ) ];
         $app;
     };

     # If you need to control the location of the file:
     return builder {
         enable 'Debug', panels => [ qw( Environment Response ) ];
         enable 'Debug::Notepad', notepad_file => '/some/path/some/file';
         $app;
     };

DESCRIPTION
    This panel gives you a little notepad right in your browser. Edit its
    content using markdown and have it rendered in html.

BUGS AND LIMITATIONS
    No bugs have been reported.

    Currently, no kind of locking mechanism is used to protect the integrity of
    your notepad. The rationale is that this module is supposed to be used
    locally and therefore no concurrent write-requests should normally occur.

    Please report any bugs or feature requests through the web interface at
    <https://github.com/mannih/Plack-Middleware-Debug-Notepad>.
